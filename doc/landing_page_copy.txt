YOU WRITE THINGS. Important things. Whether it's an email to your boss, a blog post, a grocery list, or an anniversary card, you're writing important things all the time. And you need them to be just right.

YOU COULD USE SOME HELP. Don't press the publish button until you get some feedback from people you trust. You need a simple way to share your writing and get some feedback.

PUT IT IN A WRITEFLO. It's free, and you don't even have to sign up or sign in. You just write, then click "share" to get a private link that you can send to your peers. They click the link, make some edits, and you review them. That's it.

In fact, what you're reading right now is a writeflo. I wrote it and shared it with you. Feel free to make some edits, or start a new writeflo of your own. If you need any help or want to send some feedback my way, I'm always available as @writeflo on Twitter.

Let your words flow!
